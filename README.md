# Gym Tracker

The Gym Tracker is a tool that can be used for people that go to the gym to upload and track their lifts. Based on what they enter, targets will be set for them to help them push themselves and achieve their goals. Their resultz will also update a spreadsheet so they can look at historical data.

## Features 


### Existing Features

- __Input Data__

  - This first feature allows users to input data on 6 different exercise's: Bench Press, Deadlift, Squat, Push ups, Pull ups, and Shoulder Press. This data will also be validated so the correct number of data is enterented as well as only allowing numbers. This data will then stored on a google worksheet

- __Storing data in a spreadsheet__

  - All the data entered is stored on a google spreadsheet. Three values for each lift will be stored. First is the values that the user enters from their most recent gym session. The second is a target value which is calculated for them based on their average last 5 sessions and adds 10% to encourage progression. The final value thats calculated and stored is the difference between the users results and the targets that have been set for them, allowing the user to see if they are hitting their targets 


### Features Left to Implement

- Allow users to enter each lift type seperately rather than all in one go, as this will make it more user friendly and result in less errors by the user when entering their lifts.
